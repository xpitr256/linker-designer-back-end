TRG_ER_diArg_1	The di-Arg ER retention motif is defined by two consecutive arginine residues (RR) or with a single residue insertion (RXR). The motif is completed by an adjacent hydrophobic/arginine residue which may be on either side of the Arg pair.
TRG_ER_diLys_1	ER retention and retrieving signal found at the C-terminus of type I ER membrane proteins (cytoplasmic in this topology). Di-Lysine signal is responsible for COPI-mediated retrieval from post-ER compartments.
TRG_ER_FFAT_1	VAP-A/Scs2 MSP-domain binding FFAT (diphenylalanine [FF] in an Acidic Tract) motif
TRG_ER_KDEL_1	Golgi-to-ER retrieving signal found at the C-terminus of many ER soluble proteins. It interacts with the KDEL receptor which in turns interacts with components of the coatomer (COP I).
TRG_Golgi_diPhe_1	ER to Golgi anterograde transport signal found at the C-terminus of type I ER-CGN integral membrane cargo receptors (cytoplasmic in this topology), it binds to COPII.
TRG_LysEnd_APsAcLL_1	Sorting and internalisation signal found in the cytoplasmic juxta-membrane region of type I transmembrane proteins. Targets them from the Trans Golgi Network to the lysosomal-endosomal-melanosomal compartments. Interacts with adaptor protein (AP) complexes
TRG_LysEnd_APsAcLL_3	Sorting signal found in the cytoplasmic juxta-membrane region of type I transmembrane lysosomal, endosomal and melanosomal proteins. Based on experimental evidence and alignments, this very specific ELM represents the best combination for AP3 binding.
TRG_LysEnd_GGAAcLL_1	Sorting signal directing type I transmembrane proteins from the Trans Golgi Network (TGN) to the lysosomal-endosomal compartment. It is found near the C-terminus and interacts with the VHS domain of GGAs adaptor proteins.
TRG_LysEnd_GGAAcLL_2	Internal acidic di Leucine motif found in GGA 1 and 3. It binds to their VHS domains in an autoinhibitory manner. Cycles of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of upstream Ser regulate the autoinhibitory binding and therefore the function of GGA 1/3.
TRG_NES_CRM1_1	Some proteins re-exported from the nucleus contain a Leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) binding to the CRM1 exportin protein.
TRG_NLS_Bipartite_1	Bipartite variant of the classical basically charged NLS.
TRG_NLS_MonoCore_2	Monopartite variant of the classical basically charged NLS. Strong core version.
TRG_NLS_MonoExtC_3	Monopartite variant of the classical basically charged NLS. C-extended version.
TRG_NLS_MonoExtN_4	Monopartite variant of the classical basically charged NLS. N-extended version.
TRG_PEX_1	Wxxx[FY] motifs present in N-terminal half of Pex5 bind to Pex13 and Pex14 at peroxisomal and glycosomal membranes to facilitate entrance of PTS1 cargo proteins into the organellar lumen.
TRG_PEX_2	Fxxx[WF] motifs are present in Pex19 and S. cerevisiae Pex5 cytosolic receptors that bind to peroxisomal membrane docking member, Pex14
TRG_PEX_3	LxxLLxxxLxxF motif is located in N-terminus of Pex19 receptors that are responsible for docking to Pex3 docking factor at cis side of peroxisomal membrane.
TRG_PTS1	Generic PTS1 ELM for all eukaryotes
TRG_PTS2	Generic PTS2 pattern for all eukaryotes (except lineages which have lost it)
